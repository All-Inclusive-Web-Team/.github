# All-Inclusive-Web-Team

All-Inclusive-Web-Team (AIWT) is a small educational Github organization for helping beginners learn to write code in a team setting.

## Projects

Projects are decided on by members of AIWT.
We operate by creating projects with interested beginners doing the implementation while designated mentors issue guidance where relevant.
Everyone is free to contribute if they have an addition to make.
More information will be added here as more details are fleshed out.

## Membership

Most of our communication happens on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UCTtejvK), free for anyone to join.
To join the organization, simply join the server and post your Github name, and ideally a short introduction.
Feel free to work on whatever projects are interesting to you, at your own pace.

## License

New projects should be made using the [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license.
Since this is an educational organization, we care about sharing improvements.
